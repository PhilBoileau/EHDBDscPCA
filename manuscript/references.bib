We approximate the matrix X as , where dk, uk, and vk minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X, subject to penalties on uk and vk. This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L1-penalties on uk and vk, which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L1-penalty on vk but not on uk, a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the “SCoTLASS” proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.}",

 abstract = {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an important tool of dimension reduction especially when the dimension (or the number of variables) is very high. Asymptotic studies where the sample size is fixed, and the dimension grows [i.e., High Dimension, Low Sample Size (HDLSS)] are becoming increasingly relevant. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the Principal Component (PC) directions. HDLSS asymptotics are used to study consistency, strong inconsistency and subspace consistency. We show that if the first few eigenvalues of a population covariance matrix are large enough compared to the others, then the corresponding estimated PC directions are consistent or converge to the appropriate subspace (subspace consistency) and most other PC directions are strongly inconsistent. Broad sets of sufficient conditions for each of these cases are specified and the main theorem gives a catalogue of possible combinations. In preparation for these results, we show that the geometric representation of HDLSS data holds under general conditions, which includes a ρ-mixing condition and a broad range of sphericity measures of the covariance matrix.},

abstract = "Sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods are efficient tools to reduce the dimension (or number of variables) of complex data. Sparse principal components (PCs) are easier to interpret than conventional PCs, because most loadings are zero. We study the asymptotic properties of these sparse PC directions for scenarios with fixed sample size and increasing dimension (i.e. High Dimension, Low Sample Size (HDLSS)). We consider the previously studied single spike covariance model and assume in addition that the maximal eigenvector is sparse. We extend the existing HDLSS asymptotic consistency and strong inconsistency results of conventional PCA in an entirely new direction. We find a large set of sparsity assumptions under which sparse PCA is still consistent even when conventional PCA is strongly inconsistent. The consistency of sparse PCA is characterized along with rates of convergence. Furthermore, we clearly identify the mathematical boundaries of the sparse PCA consistency, by showing strong inconsistency for an oracle version of sparse PCA beyond the consistent region, as well as its inconsistency on the boundaries of the consistent region. Simulation studies are performed to validate the asymptotic results in finite samples."

Here, we present the Splatter Bioconductor package for simple, reproducible, and well-documented simulation of scRNA-seq data.

abstract = {Dengue virus (DENV) infection induces the expansion of plasmablasts, which produce antibodies that can neutralize DENV but also enhance disease upon secondary infection with another DENV serotype. To understand how these immune responses are generated, we used a systems biological approach to analyze immune responses to dengue in humans. Transcriptomic analysis of whole blood revealed that genes encoding proinflammatory mediators and type I interferon-related proteins were associated with high DENV levels during initial symptomatic disease. Additionally, CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes increased in the blood. Similarly, in a nonhuman primate model, DENV infection boosted CD14(+)CD16(+) monocyte numbers in the blood and lymph nodes. Upon DENV infection in vitro, monocytes upregulated CD16 and mediated differentiation of resting B cells to plasmablasts as well as immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM secretion. These findings provide a detailed picture of innate responses to dengue and highlight a role for CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes in promoting plasmablast differentiation and anti-DENV antibody responses.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of mental disability. Based on the homology of Hsa21 and the murine chromosomes Mmu16, Mmu17 and Mmu10, several mouse models of DS have been developed. The most commonly used model, the Ts65Dn mouse, has been widely used to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the mental disabilities seen in DS individuals. A wide array of neuromorphological alterations appears to compromise cognitive performance in trisomic mice. Enhanced inhibition due to alterations in GABA {\textless}sub{\textgreater}A{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} -mediated transmission and disturbances in the glutamatergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic systems, among others, has also been demonstrated. DS cognitive dysfunction caused by neurodevelopmental alterations is worsened in later life stages by neurodegenerative processes. A number of pharmacological therapies have been shown to partially restore morphological anomalies concomitantly with cognition in these mice. In conclusion, the use of mouse models is enormously effective in the study of the neurobiological substrates of mental disabilities in DS and in the testing of therapies that rescue these alterations. These studies provide the basis for developing clinical trials in DS individuals and sustain the hope that some of these drugs will be useful in rescuing mental disabilities in DS individuals. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

    abstract = {Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology allow high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to be widely applied in transcriptomic studies, in particular for detecting differentially expressed genes between groups. Many software packages have been developed for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treatment groups based on RNA-Seq data. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to approach an optimal study design and choice of suitable software for the analysis. In this comparative study we evaluate the performance of three of the most frequently used software tools: Cufflinks-Cuffdiff2, DESeq and edgeR. A number of important parameters of RNA-Seq technology were taken into consideration, including the number of replicates, sequencing depth, and balanced vs. unbalanced sequencing depth within and between groups. We benchmarked results relative to sets of DEGs identified through either quantitative RT-PCR or microarray. We observed that edgeR performs slightly better than DESeq and Cuffdiff2 in terms of the ability to uncover true positives. Overall, DESeq or taking the intersection of DEGs from two or more tools is recommended if the number of false positives is a major concern in the study. In other circumstances, edgeR is slightly preferable for differential expression analysis at the expense of potentially introducing more false positives.},

abstract = {New high-dimensional, single-cell technologies offer unprecedented resolution in the analysis of heterogeneous tissues. However, because these technologies can measure dozens of parameters simultaneously in individual cells, data interpretation can be challenging. Here we present viSNE, a tool that allows one to map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the high-dimensional structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a visual similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise distances in high dimension to determine each cell's location in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with viSNE to map healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia samples map into malformed shapes that are distinct from healthy bone marrow and from each other. We also use viSNE and mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population reminiscent of minimal residual disease. viSNE can be applied to any multi-dimensional single-cell technology.},

abstract = {Single-cell transcriptome measurements can reveal unexplored biological diversity, but they suffer from technical noise and bias that must be modeled to account for the resulting uncertainty in downstream analyses. Here we introduce single-cell variational inference (scVI), a ready-to-use scalable framework for the probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells ( https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI ). scVI uses stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to aggregate information across similar cells and genes and to approximate the distributions that underlie observed expression values, while accounting for batch effects and limited sensitivity. We used scVI for a range of fundamental analysis tasks including batch correction, visualization, clustering, and differential expression, and achieved high accuracy for each task.},

	abstract = {As in other diseases associated with mental retardation, dendrite morphology and synaptic plasticity are impaired in Down{\textquoteright}s syndrome (DS). Both these features of neurons are critically influenced by BDNF, which regulates local dendritic translation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Ras{\textendash}ERK signaling cascades. Here we show that the levels of BDNF and phosphorylated Akt{\textendash}mTOR (but not Ras{\textendash}ERK) pathway proteins are augmented in hippocampal dendrites of Ts1Cje mice, a DS model. Consequently, the rate of local dendritic translation is abnormally high and the modulatory effect of exogenous BDNF is lost. Interestingly, rapamycin (a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug) restores normal levels of phosphorylated Akt-mTOR proteins and normal rates of local translation in Ts1Cje neurons, opening new therapeutic perspectives for DS. The NMDAR inhibitors APV, MK-801, and memantine also restore the normal levels of phospho-mTOR in dendrites of Ts1Cje hippocampal neurons. We propose a model to explain how BDNF-mediated regulation of local translation is lost in the Ts1Cje hippocampus through the establishment of a glutamatergic positive-feedback loop. Together, these findings help elucidate the mechanisms underlying altered synaptic plasticity in DS.},

@article{Niceta2015,
abstract = {Transcription factors operate in developmental processes to mediate inductive events and cell competence, and perturbation of their function or regulation can dramatically affect morphogenesis, organogenesis, and growth. We report that a narrow spectrum of amino-acid substitutions within the transactivation domain of the v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog (MAF), a leucine zipper-containing transcription factor of the AP1 superfamily, profoundly affect development. Seven different de novo missense mutations involving conserved residues of the four GSK3 phosphorylation motifs were identified in eight unrelated individuals. The distinctive clinical phenotype, for which we propose the eponym Aym{\'{e}}-Gripp syndrome, is not limited to lens and eye defects as previously reported for MAF/Maf loss of function but includes sensorineural deafness, intellectual disability, seizures, brachycephaly, distinctive flat facial appearance, skeletal anomalies, mammary gland hypoplasia, and reduced growth. Disease-causing mutations were demonstrated to impair proper MAF phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, perturbed gene expression in primary skin fibroblasts, and induced neurodevelopmental defects in an in vivo model. Our findings nosologically and clinically delineate a previously poorly understood recognizable multisystem disorder, provide evidence for MAF governing a wider range of developmental programs than previously appreciated, and describe a novel instance of protein dosage effect severely perturbing development.},

abstract = {Recent therapeutic investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been guided by two seemingly opposed hypotheses: the amyloid cascade theory, which favors the amyloid plaques as the cause of AD; and the cholinergic theory, which favors cholinergic neuron loss as the cause. New investigations indicate that the synthesis and processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is linked to the trophic actions of nerve growth factor. A pathological cascade in both AD- and Down's syndrome-related memory loss could be triggered by alterations in APP processing or ACh-mediated neuronal function, or both, which in turn trigger the overexpression of amyloid $\beta$, synaptic malfunction and trophic factor loss in target regions. This eventually leads to synaptic and dendritic loss with age.},

abstract = { Dengue infection (DI) transmitted by arthropod vectors is the viral disease with the highest incidence throughout the world, an estimated 300 million cases per year. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors may also influence the manifestation of the disease; as even in endemic areas, only a small proportion of people develop the most serious form. Immune-response gene polymorphisms may be associated with the development of cases of DI. The aim of this study was to determine allele frequencies in the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 loci in a Southern Brazil population with dengue virus serotype 3, confirmed by the ELISA serological method, and a control group. The identification of the HLA alleles was carried out using the SSO genotyping PCR program (One Lambda), based on Luminex technology. In conclusion, this study suggests that DQB1 * 06:11 allele could act as susceptible factors to dengue virus serotype 3, while HLA-DRB1 * 11 and DQA1 * 05:01 could act as resistance factors. },

abstract = {The CD27 and CD38 antigens are highly expressed on the plasmablast surface, and a massive plasmablast response has been described for dengue virus infection. Soluble CD27 and CD38 forms (sCD27 and sCD38, respectively) increase after immune activation. Here, we show increased sCD27 release in cultures of purified polyclonally stimulated B cells. T and B cells isolated from children with dengue spontaneously produced higher levels of sCD27 but not sCD38, compared with healthy children (P=0.03), and sCD27 levels positively correlated with plasmablast frequency in the cultures (rho=0.58, P=0.01). Children with dengue had higher plasma levels of sCD27 and sCD38 than healthy children, which decreased during convalescence. Plasma sCD27 was higher in severe than with mild dengue, but the opposite was observed for sCD38. These findings support a potential new role for B cells in dengue pathogenesis, and sCD27 and sCD38 are novel biomarkers associated with clinical outcome during dengue virus infection.},

abstract = {The type I interferons (IFNs), IFN-$\alpha$ and -$\beta$, are key effector molecules of the immune response to viruses. The anti-viral action of IFNs on virus-infected cells and surrounding tissues is mediated by expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. Viperin (virus inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, IFN-inducible) is an Interferon stimulated gene (ISG), which is induced by type I, II, and III IFNs or after infection with a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. Recent evidence indicates that Viperin disrupts lipid rafts to block influenza virus budding and release and interferes with replication of hepatitis C virus by binding to lipid droplets, small organelles involved in lipid homeostasis that are essential for hepatitis C virus replication. Viperin is also induced by nonviral microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by a wide range of bacteria, suggesting a broader role in innate antimicrobial defenses.},
